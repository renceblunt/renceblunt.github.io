        <h2>Hello, I’m Rence Blunt</h2>
        <p>
          Poetry has always been my safe space — a way to pour emotions into words, 
          and give voice to thoughts that often stay unspoken. Through rhythm, rhyme, 
          and free verse, I try to capture the quiet depth of human experience.  
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is a collection of my poems, reflections, and highlights. 
          It’s a journey of self-expression, vulnerability, and creativity, 
          and I hope that in these words you find something that speaks to you.
